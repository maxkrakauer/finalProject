It's about five people with an important liaison to one another. The characters are all avoiding being truthful about the realities of their lives and waiting for some miracle to happen. Instead of optimistically continuing their efforts, they find asylum in lies and falsities. The name suits the plot as all the main characters are wishing a Happy End to their existing problems while not doing much practically to improve their Present. This movie is 3rd in sequence of Björn Runge's Trilogy of Liberation. The two earlier movies are ""Daybreak"" and ""Mouth to Mouth"" respectively. The main idea behind these 3 movies is to portray the lives of people who are trying to liberate themselves from destruction."

But both Arthur and Larry get turfed out into a motel when Larry's wife Judy, who wants a divorce, moves her lover, Sy, into the house and even after Sy's death in a car crash they are still there.

And the rabbis he visits for advice only dole out platitudes. Still God moves in mysterious - and not always pleasant - ways, as Larry and his family will find out."
