It's about five people with an important liaison to one another. The characters are all avoiding being truthful about the realities of their lives and waiting for some miracle to happen. Instead of optimistically continuing their efforts, they find asylum in lies and falsities. The name suits the plot as all the main characters are wishing a Happy End to their existing problems while not doing much practically to improve their Present. This movie is 3rd in sequence of Bj√∂rn Runge's Trilogy of Liberation. The two earlier movies are ""Daybreak"" and ""Mouth to Mouth"" respectively. The main idea behind these 3 movies is to portray the lives of people who are trying to liberate themselves from destruction."
