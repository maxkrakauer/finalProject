BLOOD RUSH is unlike any other crime series on TV. Boomtown meets CSI, it reinvents the genre. Truth is slippery. One man's testimony is another's man's lie. Evidence appears to be definitive - but in whose hands? With whose construction? There's never only one version. The truth depends on where you're standing. How many points of view make the whole story? A distinctive and gritty multi-angled drama, BLOOD RUSH uses breakneck jumps of viewpoint and the time-frame to uncover crime stories from the points of view of everyone involved. Chronologies are rolled backwards, forwards and overlapped as the story unravels. The diverse perspectives of detectives, cops, forensic scientists, pathologists, profilers, victims and perpetrators take us deep into the heart of the story. And finally to the truth. THERE'S ALWAYS MORE THAN ONE PERSPECTIVE TO A CRIME. EVERY POV TELLS A STORY."

The story is rather thin and depended on the fact that divorce, in the 1930's, was not only difficult but almost impossible in New York. Mrs. Stephen Haynes learns that her husband is seeing a salesgirl at Saks, and reluctantly divorces him, abetted by her friends, all of whom have romantic problems of their own.

The 1939 film, starring Norma Shearer, Paulette Goddard, Rosalind Russell, and Joan Crawford, was a hit.
