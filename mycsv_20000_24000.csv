Hoping to get a beautiful card reading, they end up receiving an awful reading from a Tarot card reader. According to the opened cards, someone is coming from the past to take one of their lives. Tristan doesn't believe in the reading, but Julie can't get her mind off it because of the guilt she's feeling toward her twin sister, Sofia, who was born with a disfigured face. Sofia ended up committing suicide because she was jealous of Julie's beauty. And so Julie begins to feel restless. She has nightmares, she gets bruises when she wakes up, and visions of her twin sister, which she keeps on having, convince Julie that Tristan and her are in danger. The Tarot card reader says there is nothing they can do and so the terror gets out of control.They are unable to get away from the Tarot reading."
